            <h2>
                Here's a simplified step-by-step guide to purchasing a domain,
                setting up a static webpage on GitHub (or GitLab), and using it as an alternative to a 3rd Party Link
                site:
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Purchase a domain: Start by choosing and purchasing a domain name from a domain registrar like
                    GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. A domain name is the address that people will use to access
                    your webpage (e.g., www.yourname.com).</li>
                <li>Sign up for a GitHub or GitLab account: Create an account on either GitHub (www.github.com) or
                    GitLab (www.gitlab.com). These platforms allow you to host and manage your website's code.</li>
                <li>Create a new repository: In your GitHub or GitLab account, create a new repository specifically for
                    your website. Give it a name like "yourname.github.io" (for GitHub) or "yourname.gitlab.io" (for
                    GitLab). This special naming convention is required for hosting a static webpage on these platforms.
                </li>
                <li>Design your webpage: Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) that will serve as the main content of
                    your webpage. You can use a simple text editor like Notepad or a code editor like Visual Studio Code
                    to write your HTML code. Add your desired content, such as links to your social media profiles or
                    other websites.</li>
                <li>Upload your webpage: Once your HTML file is ready, go to your GitHub or GitLab repository and upload
                    the file to the repository. If using GitHub, you can directly drag and drop the file into the
                    repository's file list. If using GitLab, you'll need to use Git commands or the web interface to
                    push the file to the repository.</li>
                <li>Enable GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages: Now, go to your repository settings and look for the option to
                    enable GitHub Pages (in GitHub) or GitLab Pages (in GitLab). This feature allows you to publish your
                    webpage to a live website. Choose the branch or directory containing your HTML file as the source
                    for your webpage.</li>
                <li>Set up your domain: Go back to your domain registrar's website and look for DNS (Domain Name System)
                    settings or domain management options. Locate the section where you can configure DNS records.</li>
                <li>Configure DNS records: Add a new DNS record, typically called a CNAME record or an ALIAS record,
                    depending on your domain registrar's terminology. In the record settings, point the record to your
                    GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages URL. It will usually look like "yourname.github.io" or
                    "yourname.gitlab.io". Save the changes.</li>
                <li>Wait for DNS propagation: After configuring the DNS records, it may take some time (usually a few
                    minutes to a few hours) for the changes to propagate across the internet. This process allows your
                    domain to correctly point to your GitHub or GitLab Pages.</li>
                <li> Test your webpage: Once the DNS propagation is complete, open a web browser and type your domain
                    name (e.g., www.yourname.com). You should see your static webpage displayed with the content you
                    added. Test the links on the page to ensure they are working correctly.</li>

            <h2>A guide to help you moderate topical audio meetings as a host</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Prepare and Plan Ahead: Before starting a ùïè Space, plan the topic, agenda, and any specific
                    guidelines or rules you want to enforce. Consider the purpose, tone, and desired outcome of the
                    Space. This will help you set expectations and create a smoother moderation experience.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Introduce the Space: Start by introducing yourself as the host and briefly explain the topic or
                    purpose of the Space. Welcome participants and set the tone for respectful and inclusive
                    discussions.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Set Clear Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for participant behavior. Clearly communicate the
                    rules at the beginning of the Space and remind participants periodically. Encourage respectful
                    dialogue, discourage personal attacks or harassment, and establish consequences for violating the
                    guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Monitor and Manage Participants: Keep an eye on the participant list and actively manage the
                    conversation. You can use the "Mute" or "Remove" options to handle disruptive participants. Be fair
                    and consistent in enforcing the guidelines, but also allow for diverse perspectives and opinions.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Encourage Balanced Participation: Encourage active participation from a diverse range of voices.
                    Facilitate discussions by inviting participants to share their thoughts or ask questions. Ensure
                    that everyone gets an opportunity to contribute, and politely redirect or intervene if certain
                    participants dominate the conversation.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Manage Speaking Requests: As the host, you have control over who can speak. Manage speaking requests
                    by inviting participants to speak or utilizing the "Hand Raise" feature for participants to request
                    speaking privileges. Moderate the speaking order to maintain a balanced and engaging discussion.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Address Questions and Comments: Monitor the chat or question feature and address relevant questions
                    or comments. Read them aloud or summarize them for the participants, and provide thoughtful
                    responses or invite other participants to share their perspectives.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Handle Conflict and Disagreements: In case of disagreements or conflicts between participants, act
                    as a mediator. Encourage respectful dialogue, promote active listening, and facilitate constructive
                    discussions. If necessary, step in to de-escalate tensions and guide the conversation back to a
                    productive path.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Keep the Space on Track: Stay focused on the intended topic or agenda of the Space. Guide the
                    conversation, ask thought-provoking questions, and steer participants back on track if the
                    discussion veers off-topic for too long.
                </li>
                <li>

                    End on a Positive Note: Thank participants for their contributions and bring the Space to a close on
                    a positive and respectful note. Recap key points discussed and express your gratitude for their
                    participation. Encourage participants to continue the conversation elsewhere, such as by sharing
                    resources or connecting on other platforms.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Remember, effective moderation requires active engagement, impartiality, and an inclusive
                    environment. Adapt these guidelines to suit your specific needs and goals as a host.

                Leave the phones at home.

                Why not embrace real-world connections? Engage in meaningful conversations by setting up meetings with
                people you know in public, safe locations. Challenge ideas, encourage debates, and foster understanding.
            </p>

                Instead of living in a world of disconnected fantasies and isolation, let ideas flow freely. Break free
                from the confines of slogans and connect with the humanity in others, rather than being defined solely
                by political identities that can stifle independent thinking.
            </p>

                By actively participating in face-to-face interactions, you reclaim your autonomy and prevent others
                from shaping your thoughts. Embrace the power of genuine human connections and take control of your
                intellectual journey.
