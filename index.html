                    Plus, having your own website establishes credibility, enhances your online identity,

            Here's a simplified step-by-step guide to purchasing a domain, 
            setting up a static webpage on GitHub (or GitLab), and using it as an alternative to a 3rd Party Link site:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Purchase a domain: Start by choosing and purchasing a domain name from a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. A domain name is the address that people will use to access your webpage (e.g., www.yourname.com).</li>
            <li>Sign up for a GitHub or GitLab account: Create an account on either GitHub (www.github.com) or GitLab (www.gitlab.com). These platforms allow you to host and manage your website's code.</li>
            <li>Create a new repository: In your GitHub or GitLab account, create a new repository specifically for your website. Give it a name like "yourname.github.io" (for GitHub) or "yourname.gitlab.io" (for GitLab). This special naming convention is required for hosting a static webpage on these platforms.</li>
            <li>Design your webpage: Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) that will serve as the main content of your webpage. You can use a simple text editor like Notepad or a code editor like Visual Studio Code to write your HTML code. Add your desired content, such as links to your social media profiles or other websites.</li>
            <li>Upload your webpage: Once your HTML file is ready, go to your GitHub or GitLab repository and upload the file to the repository. If using GitHub, you can directly drag and drop the file into the repository's file list. If using GitLab, you'll need to use Git commands or the web interface to push the file to the repository.</li>
            <li>Enable GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages: Now, go to your repository settings and look for the option to enable GitHub Pages (in GitHub) or GitLab Pages (in GitLab). This feature allows you to publish your webpage to a live website. Choose the branch or directory containing your HTML file as the source for your webpage.</li>
            <li>Set up your domain: Go back to your domain registrar's website and look for DNS (Domain Name System) settings or domain management options. Locate the section where you can configure DNS records.</li>
            <li>Configure DNS records: Add a new DNS record, typically called a CNAME record or an ALIAS record, depending on your domain registrar's terminology. In the record settings, point the record to your GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages URL. It will usually look like "yourname.github.io" or "yourname.gitlab.io". Save the changes.</li>
            <li>Wait for DNS propagation: After configuring the DNS records, it may take some time (usually a few minutes to a few hours) for the changes to propagate across the internet. This process allows your domain to correctly point to your GitHub or GitLab Pages.</li>
            <li> Test your webpage: Once the DNS propagation is complete, open a web browser and type your domain name (e.g., www.yourname.com). You should see your static webpage displayed with the content you added. Test the links on the page to ensure they are working correctly.</li>
        </ol>

            This isn't a platform
        </h2>
        <p>
            Platforms want to build walled gardens.
        </p><p>
            They want you to stay in their gated community.
        </p><p>
            Let's make bridges to all the communities we care about and provide an index to communicate.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Online Presence?
        </h2>
    <p>
        Leave the phones at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why not embrace real-world connections? Engage in meaningful conversations by setting up meetings with people you know in public, safe locations. Challenge ideas, encourage debates, and foster understanding.
    </p><p>
        
        Instead of living in a world of disconnected fantasies and isolation, let ideas flow freely. Break free from the confines of slogans and connect with the humanity in others, rather than being defined solely by political identities that can stifle independent thinking.
    </p><p>
        
        By actively participating in face-to-face interactions, you reclaim your autonomy and prevent others from shaping your thoughts. Embrace the power of genuine human connections and take control of your intellectual journey.
